//! Spotting a torrent's files deleted outside Phantom. librqbit opens each file once and keeps it
//! open, so it never notices one deleted, renamed or replaced: it goes on writing into the deleted
//! file and reports it complete. So the engine looks for itself, by name and size:
//!
//! - [`missing`] says which files aren't on disk as they must be. Only files whose priority is
//!   Normal count. One is missing when nothing is at its path, something other than a file is, or
//!   the file's size is one it can't have: larger than its full size, or smaller than the bytes
//!   librqbit has of it (pieces are written in place, so a file is at least as long as the end of
//!   the last piece it has; after a check librqbit sets each Normal file to its full size). A file
//!   replaced by another of a size that fits isn't caught: that's what Check is for.
//! - [`Watcher`] watches the torrents' destinations, recursively, so a torrent's own folder going
//!   is seen too, and reports the paths removed or renamed under them (and some more, see
//!   [`goes`]), so the actor looks at once.
//!   The actor also looks at every torrent every few seconds, for what the watcher misses (a file
//!   cut short, or a destination that couldn't be watched).
//! - At stop the store records each torrent's files as [`Expected`]; the next start checks them
//!   before librqbit restores the torrents, because restoring creates a missing file again, empty.
